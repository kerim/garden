# Static garden exporter

Builds a reading website from **Logseq 2.0.1 DB graph -> Export public pages**.
It reads the graph embedded in `index.html` and emits one HTML document per page.
There is no Logseq runtime or browser database in the output.

## Build and preview

From the repository root:

```sh
./build-static.sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
```

Requirements: Python 3.10+ with venv support and Node.js. The wrapper creates
`.venv-static/` and installs the pinned Python dependencies. Node runs the exported
KaTeX bundle and the graph layout script; neither requires an npm install.

Once dependencies are installed, an offline build can run directly:

```sh
.venv-static/bin/python static-garden/build.py
```

The CLI also accepts `--source`, `--output`, and `--config` paths:

```sh
./build-static.sh --source /path/to/public-export --output /path/to/site
```

The build uses a temporary directory, checks block coverage and attachment sizes,
then replaces the generated output. It refuses to replace the source or an
unrelated nonempty directory. `dist-report.json` records counts, sizes, and warnings
beside the output, outside the deployed website.

## Publishing and hooks

Cloudflare Pages uses **`./build-static.sh`** with output directory **`dist`** and
framework preset **None**. The repository root is the build root. A normal update
is a fresh public export, a commit, and a push; Pages runs the build automatically.
Direct uploads must contain the contents of `dist/`.

Install the local hook once per clone with `./install-hooks.sh`, after the first
build has initialized the venv. The tracked `.githooks/pre-commit` validates an
isolated copy of the **Git index**, including partially staged files and deletions.
It does not install dependencies, modify the working tree, replace `dist/`, or
stage files. Root README and screenshot changes skip validation; changes under
`static-garden/` trigger it. An existing hook is backed up during installation.

`patch-index.py` is not part of this pipeline. Asset compression is a separate,
manual operation; a referenced file larger than Pages' 25 MiB limit fails the build.

## Rendering

| Source feature | Published behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Blocks and properties | Nested HTML outlines, native collapse controls, visible property values |
| Page and block references | Links to pages and block anchors |
| Tags, nested pages, backlinks | Collections and related-page lists computed at build time |
| Code and equations | Pygments highlighting and native MathML, rendered during the build |
| Graph | Build-time layout with a Canvas viewer loaded only on `/graph/` |
| Search | Full-text JSON index fetched on the first query |
| Old `#/page/` bookmarks | Small script resolves exported names and UUIDs to static routes |
| Images, audio, video, PDFs | Referenced files copied; lazy images and media with `preload="none"` |
| Other attachments | Downloads with original filenames offered by the links |

Page URLs include a UUID suffix to avoid slug collisions. Renaming a page changes
its slug; legacy UUID hash bookmarks still resolve. Reading, all-pages browsing,
and collapsing blocks work without JavaScript. Search and the graph require it.

On phones, a bottom navigation bar provides Home, Pages, Search, Graph, and an
expandable Explore menu. The menu works without JavaScript. Graph touch targets
are larger than mouse targets; tapping selects a page and shows an Open page link
inside the graph. Dragging and pinch-to-zoom remain available.

`site.json` controls the collection links in both the desktop sidebar and the
mobile Explore menu. Links appear only when their targets exist in the public export.
Set `"embed_titles": false` in `site.json` to omit the title link above page embeds (default `true`). Set `"embed_style": "inline"` in `site.json` to render embedded pages/blocks as plain sub-blocks with no box, no title, and no bullet for the embed block itself (default `"boxed"`, the current boxed behavior; `embed_titles` only affects `"boxed"`).

## Security and attachments

Raw HTML is disabled in Markdown. Graph text is not evaluated as code, and link
schemes are restricted to HTTP(S), mail, and telephone links. KaTeX runs at build
time with `trust: false`. Search and graph labels use DOM text nodes.

The generated `_headers` supplies a Content Security Policy with no inline script
or eval allowance, blocks framing and object embeds, and sets `nosniff` and a
referrer policy. Scripts, styles, and fetched data must come from the site itself;
external images and audio/video must use HTTPS.

Local attachments have two destinations:

- `/assets/`: allowlisted raster images, audio, video, and PDFs retain their URLs.
- `/downloads/`: every other format, including HTML, SVG, scripts, and office
  documents, receives a `.download` suffix. Links offer the original filename.
  Cloudflare serves these as `application/octet-stream` with
  `Content-Disposition: attachment` and an additional sandbox CSP. They cannot
  become executable pages on the garden's origin.

The only local SVG served as an image is the trusted logo from `branding/`. Asset paths
and symlinks escaping the source's `assets/` directory fail the build. Attachment
contents are not modified or scanned for malware; downloaded files remain untrusted.
Old direct URLs to files moved into `/downloads/` change; generated note links
point to the new locations.

These response headers depend on the host honoring
[Cloudflare's `_headers` format](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/).
Python's preview server does not apply them. A different host needs equivalent
header configuration. The raw export's root `_headers` is not used for `dist/`.

Only referenced local assets are copied, and the build reads only the public
export. It never opens the private Logseq database. This is not a secret scanner:
exported text, property labels, attachments, search data, and Git history can still
contain information that was published accidentally.

## Format limits

The Transit reader supports the types used by this Logseq DB export and rejects
unknown types. It does not support the older Markdown-graph export format.

Plugins, editing, flashcard scheduling, arbitrary Hiccup/HTML, and live Datalog
queries are outside the renderer. Page and block embeds (`{{embed}}`) render
inline; other unsupported query or macro syntax remains readable source and
produces a warning. Missing references and attachments,
unsupported links, and equation errors are also reported. Missing private targets
are never fetched; an exported property value may still expose its label without
a corresponding public page body.

## URL styles

`site.json`'s `"url_style"` controls how page URLs and breadcrumbs are built. It defaults
to `"uuid"`: every page (other than home) gets `/page/<slug>--<uuid>/`, and the breadcrumb
walks `block/parent` ancestry.

Setting `"url_style": "sections"` instead groups pages under the navigation entry that
references them:

- Each navigation page gets a bare top-level URL, e.g. `/technology/`.
- A page is assigned to the first navigation page (in `navigation` order) whose blocks —
  at any depth — reference it via `block/refs`, an embed's `block/link`, or a `[[link]]`
  in a block's title. That page then gets `/<section-slug>/<page-slug>/`, and its
  breadcrumb reads Home › Section › Page, with Section linked.
- A page no navigation entry reaches gets `/<page-slug>/`, with a two-level breadcrumb
  (Home › Page).
- Slugs are lowercased, with runs of punctuation/whitespace collapsed to a single hyphen.
- If two pages would resolve to the same URL, the first one (by navigation order, then
  title) keeps it; the rest fall back to `/<slug>--<uuid>/`, with a build warning. The
  same fallback applies if a top-level slug collides with a reserved path (`pages`,
  `graph`, `site`, `assets`, `licenses`, `downloads`, `404.html`, `robots.txt`,
  `sitemap.xml`, `_headers`).

## Project files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `site.json` | Homepage, navigation, title, description, language, canonical URL, optional `author`/`license` (rendered as the sidebar license note; a `license` name is linked when it's a known one such as `"CC BY 4.0"`), optional `url_style` (see below) |
| `build.py` / `transit_reader.py` | Decode the graph, render pages, copy attachments, emit headers |
| `garden.css` / `garden.js` | Main layout, search, legacy bookmarks |
| `graph-layout.cjs` / `graph.js` / `graph.css` | Graph layout and browser viewer |
| `branding/logo.svg` / `logo.png` | Canonical site identity, preserved across Logseq exports |
| `check-staged.py` | Validate a staged export during pre-commit |

Branding is copied to the hashed SVG used for the favicon, `static/img/logo.png`,
and `favicon.png` in the output. Generated pages also include canonical URLs,
a sitemap, and a real `404.html` rather than an SPA fallback.

## Tests

```sh
.venv-static/bin/python -m unittest discover -s static-garden -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

Tests cover Transit decoding, rendering, page filtering, reference handling,
attachment containment, script injection, download routing, generated security
headers, and the hook's behavior with real isolated Git indices.

## License

The original exporter, browser code, and build tools are [MIT licensed](../licenses/MIT.txt);
see [LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md) for the exact scope. The original Logseq export
remains under its upstream terms. [Third-party notices](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
include the source revision embedded in the export and the bundled license texts.

The build copies `licenses/`, the license scope, and third-party notices into
`dist/licenses/`, linked from each page's footer. Keep these files with the
exporter when copying it to another project. The hook validates licensing changes
as build inputs. Garden content and branding are not covered by the MIT grant.
